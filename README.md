In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, access to real-time information during critical events is of paramount importance. DisasterAlertAI is a web platform designed to address this need. It leverages cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) technology, specifically a BERT classifier, to analyze tweets and determine whether they contain information related to disasters. This platform empowers users, including emergency responders and concerned community members, by providing rapid evaluations of tweet content.

DisasterAlertAI offers a user-friendly web interface that accepts user input in two forms: typed tweets or tweet links. Users can either manually enter a tweet or provide a link to a tweet they wish to analyze. The platform's backend, implemented using Django or FastAPI, handles the user input and retrieves tweet content accordingly. If a tweet link is provided, the system employs web scraping techniques to extract the tweet's content from Twitter. Next, the tweet content undergoes preprocessing to ensure optimal model input. The heart of DisasterAlertAI lies in its BERT classifier, which has been trained to predict whether a tweet pertains to a disaster. The platform instantly returns the prediction to the user, effectively informing them whether the tweet contains information about a disaster or not.

The primary outcome of DisasterAlertAI is to empower users with timely and accurate information during critical events. By rapidly assessing tweet content, the platform assists in disaster recognition and response, potentially saving lives and mitigating the impact of disasters. The user-centric approach prioritizes satisfaction and ensures that users receive notifications and visual representations of disaster-related tweets. This focus on user experience enhances the platform's effectiveness and accessibility.
